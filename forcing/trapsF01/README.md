# LO/forcing/trapsF##

(January 2024)
trapsF01 is identical to trapsF00 (realistic conditions), except that there are no nutrients coming from WWTP effluent. i.e. NO3 and NH4 concentrations are set to zero for all point sources (all w-sources). This includes all WWTPs in both US and Canadian waters, and also factories as well. In all cases, the factories had zero or low DIN dischage to begin with. Thus, these changes to the factory nutrient discharges are not expected to make a significant difference relative to changes in WWTP discharge.
